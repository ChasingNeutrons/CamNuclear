# Research

Our overarching goal is to expand the use of nuclear technology through designing more economical reactors that can achieve a wider range of missions. This is also enabled by devising new methods to more rapidly and accurately simulate and optimise these reactors, decreasing their conservatism.

Here are some themes that we currently work on:

**Monte Carlo methods for radiation transport.** We have developed [SCONE](https://github.com/CambridgeNuclear/SCONE), a Monte Carlo particle transport code designed for ease of modifiability. SCONE supports the full range of neutron physics relevant for nuclear reactor applications, can perform fixed source and k-eigenvalue calculations, and runs in parallel using OpenMP. It has been used to explore methods to accelerate Monte Carlo using hybrid continuous energy/multi-group data representation, investigating the random ray method, and introducing students to Monte Carlo algorithms.


**Space reactors.** 

**Salt-cooled high temperature reactors.**
